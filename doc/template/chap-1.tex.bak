\subsection{An item}
Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
So \emph{never write}: 
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the first one;
  \item the second one;
  \item the third one.
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
But write:
\begin{quote}
  The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
  third one.
\end{quote}
