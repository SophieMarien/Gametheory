% -- Situation -- %
In this era where digitalization becomes prominent in every aspect of our lives, where technology is growing fast and where business are always under attack, security becomes an issue of increasing complexity. Without security, their is no protection to keep somebody out of a system. It is the same as leaving the door of your house open for everybody to come in. It is important to keep a system secure. \todo{waarom? :  lekken van informatie, DOSS attacks, ..} A hacker will be a person that seeks exploits or weaknesses in a system or network, to be able to gain access.  Many of those attacks have a different cause. Some of the attacks by a hacker can be benign, others can be harmful. Their are variant ways to break into a system. 

% -- Complication -- %
It is difficult to protect a system or network against all this variant threats. 
Game theory is more and more used to model Cyber Security. Game theory analyses in this case a game where the interactions are between an attacker and a defender of a system, where both players have to make decisions. Both players want to .. 
%-- Question -- %
In this paper we want to focus on situations where a computer network is attacked by APT. These threats will infect the network by means of a virus that will propagate through the network. 

% -- Anwer -- %
We propose an addition to the basic FlipIt model to model a scenario where the moves by the attacker will not be instantaneous. Next we analyse what the new Nash equilibria will be and ..
