Elke beweging of flip wordt aangegeven met een blauw of oranje cirkel. De aanvaller is vertegenwoordigd in het oranje en speelt met een periode van $ \delta _{A} = 4 $. De verdediger is vertegenwoordigd in het blauw en speelt met een periode van $ \delta _{D} = 3 $. De blauwe en oranje rechthoeken geven de hoeveelheid tijd die de betreffende speler in de controle is van de bron.}}{vi}{figure.0.1}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces The first game is the basic FlipIt game. The second is a FlipIt game with a delay. During the first flip of the attacker, the defender moves after the delay, causing the attacker to get control over the resource. During the second flip of the attacker, the defender flips at time t+d, causing the defender to take control over the resource before the attacker. During the third and final flip of the attacker, the defender flips during time t+d, causing the attacker to never gain control over the resource. }}{18}{figure.3.1}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces Formalization of a FlipIt game with delay: A representation of a FlipIt game where both players are playing periodically. Every move or flip is indicated by a blue or orange circle, respectively dark gray and light grey. The defender is represented in blue (dark grey) and plays with a period of $\delta _{D}$. The flip of the attacker is represented by a white circle, but because there is a delay d, the attacker only controls the resource after time d represented by an orange circle (light grey). The attacker plays with a period of $\delta _{A}$. The blue and orange rectangles represent the amount of time the respective player is in control of the resource.}}{21}{figure.3.2}
