abstract = {Loss of mobility can occur for a variety of reasons,such as spinal cord injury or motor neurone disease. The onset of these conditions often brings with it an associated loss of personal independence, which is primarily due to the fact that the sufferer is no longer able to control their mobility. This project aims to address this problem through the creation of a head movement based wheelchair control system. Using a personal digital assistant (PDA) artificial intelligence techniques on an embedded LINUX operating system, a wireless head movement wheelchair control system has been designed and implemented. This system provides relief for sufferers of conditions which inhibit mobility through a method of wheelchair control which offers enhanced ease of use, attractiveness and independence.},

@article{DefendingAgainstUnknownEnemy,
abstract = {Most cryptographic systems carry the basic assumption that entities are able to preserve the secrecy of their keys. With attacks today showing ever increasing sophistication, however, this tenet is eroding. “Advanced Persistent Threats” (APTs), for instance, leverage zero-day exploits and extensive system knowledge to achieve full compromise of cryptographic keys and other secrets. Such compromise is often silent, with defenders failing to detect the loss of private keys critical to protection of their systems. The growing virulence of today’s
threats clearly calls for new models of defenders’ goals and abilities. In this paper, we explore applications of FLIPIT, a novel game-theoretic model of system defense introduced in [17]. In FLIPIT, an attacker periodically gains complete control of a system, with the unique feature that system compromises are stealthy, i.e., not immediately detected by the system owner, called the defender. We distill out several lessons from our study of FLIPIT and demonstrate their application to several real-world problems, including password reset policies, key rotation, VM refresh and cloud auditing.},

@article{FlipThem,
abstract = {Recent high-profile targeted attacks showed that even the most secure and secluded networks can be compromised by motivated and resourceful attackers, and that such a system compromise may not be immediately detected by the system owner. Researchers at RSA proposed the FlipIt game to study the impact of such stealthy takeovers. In the basic FlipIt game, an attacker and a defender fight over a single resource; in practice, however, systems typically consist of multiple resources that can be targeted. In this paper, we present FlipThem, a generalization of FlipIt to multiple resources. To formulate the players’ goals and study their best strategies, we introduce two control models: in the AND model, the attacker has to compromise all resources in order to take over the entire system, while in the OR model, she has to compromise only one. Our analytical and numerical results provide practical recommendations for defenders.},
